   Each year a large group of earnest folks organize, prepare and walk 60 miles through the cities of the Seattle area. This is all done to support the look for the cure of cancer, breast cancer to be specific. For the second year in a row, my daughter has committed  herself to walking  those 60 miles. She is a bean counter (accountant) who happens to work for one of the coffee giants and is part of a team called the  Sassy Sirens . The whole idea is grand in scale but imagine if you will walking for 20 plus miles, sleeping on the ground, waking and walking 20 miles then sleeping on the ground only to wake and walk another 20 miles. Last year her feet, knees and hips took a pounding. Even after all the pain from 2007, she joined the team again this year.   I trained a bit with my girl this summer. We walked 8 miles two days in a row. the third day I was beat. And I had not slept on the ground! I will unabashedly say that she is one of my heroes for even attempting this. We are going to be in the crowd who cheers her into the stadium on Sunday. And not just her but all the folks who hurt so that others might never face the big C.   Go girl! you are my hero!
