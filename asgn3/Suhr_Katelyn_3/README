Notes:

To run the file: python3 restaurant-competition-P1.py -e review_file -o predictions_file

The default: python3 restaurant-competition-P1.py 

This default takes in dev_examples.tsv as the eval_file and outputsthe predictions to restaurant-compeition-model-P1-predictions.txt

The feature vector files will be generated everytime the code is run. Hopefully, it overrides the old file everytime it's run.

Binary files are created for the classifier once you run the program. My bad about this, I didn't have time to figure out how to fix this or if that will be an issue.
